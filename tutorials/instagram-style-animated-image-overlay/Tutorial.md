# Animated Image Overlay in React Native

When you like a picture on Instagram a heart quickly scales and fades in over the image you liked - how would we go about accomplishing the same in React Native? In this quick tutorial weâ€™ll cover exactly that.

## Getting Started
This tutorial builds on top of a [previous tutorial](https://github.com/HandlebarLabs/react-native-examples-and-tutorials/blob/master/tutorials/instagram-style-double-tap/Tutorial.md) in which we implement a double tap component.

To get started, create a new project with Create React Native App.

```
create-react-native-app AnimatedImageOverlay
cd AnimatedImageOverlay
```

Next, download the following zip file, unzip it, and place it in your new React Native project. Make sure to name the directory `src`.

[Starting zip](tutorial-assets/src.zip)

Then update `App.js` to be

```javascript
import App from './src';

export default App;
```

## Overlaying Images

We'll start off by adding the necessary styles to successfully overlay an image on another.

First we'll create a new method to render the overlayed image.

```javascript
export default class App extends React.Component {
  // ...

  renderOverlay = () => {
    return (
      <View style={styles.overlay}>
        <Image
          source={require('./images/heart.png')}
          style={styles.overlayHeart}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }

  // ...
}
```

We'll then render the overlay. The `DoubleTap` component only accepts one child so we need to wrap our `Image` component in a `View`. Fortunantely, this helps with layout as well.

```javascript
export default class App extends React.Component {
  // ...

  render() {
    return (
      <View style={styles.container}>
        <DoubleTap onDoubleTap={this.toggleLike}>
          <View>
            <Image
              source={{ uri: `https://images.pexels.com/photos/671557/pexels-photo-671557.jpeg?auto=compress&cs=tinysrgb&dpr=2&w=${w.width}` }}
              style={{ width: w.width, height: w.width }}
              resizeMode="cover"
            />
            {this.renderOverlay()}
          </View>
        </DoubleTap>
        {/* ... */}
      </View>
    );
  }
}
```

That leaves us with the following:

![Step 1](tutorial-assets/01.png)

To fix this we'll setup some absolute positioning for the containing view to take up the full area and center its contents. We'll also set the `tintColor` of the image to white.

```javascript
const styles = StyleSheet.create({
  // ...
  overlay: {
    position: 'absolute',
    alignItems: 'center',
    justifyContent: 'center',
    left: 0,
    right: 0,
    top: 0,
    bottom: 0,
  },
  overlayHeart: {
    tintColor: '#fff',
  },
});
```

## Animating the Image

First thing we need to do to animate the image: import `Animated` from React Native.

We'll then set up a new animated value on the component. This will drive both the opacity change and scaling thanks to our ability to interpolate animated values in React Native.

```javascript
export default class App extends React.Component {
  // ...

  animatedValue = new Animated.Value(0);

  // ...
}
```

Next we'll modify the `animatedValue` when we've liked the picture. To do this we'll modify the `toggleLike` method. If the image is liked we'll start an animated sequence that brings `this.animatedValue` to a value of 1 and immediately brings it back to 0. I'm going to use `Animated.spring` because I like the way it looks here.

```javascript
export default class App extends React.Component {
  // ...

  toggleLike = () => {
    this.setState((state) => {
      const newLiked = !state.liked;

      if (newLiked) {
        Animated.sequence([
          Animated.spring(this.animatedValue, { toValue: 1 }),
          Animated.spring(this.animatedValue, { toValue: 0 }),
        ]).start();
      }

      return { liked: newLiked };
    });
  }

  // ...
}
```

Last thing we'll do is modify the `renderOverlay` method to use our animated value to modify the styles. First, replace the `Image` component with an `Animated.Image` so that we can use animated values and the component knows what to do with them.

We'll then set up an array of of our new image styles. First will be our existing `styles.overlayHeart`, next will be an object with our dynamic styles.

Opacity is a value from 0 to 1 so we can just pass that directly to `opacity`. We'll then use the `scale` property to start the image slightly smaller and scale larger. We can specify the exact values by using `this.animatedValue.interpolate`. Here's the code.

```javascript
export default class App extends React.Component {
  // ...

  renderOverlay = () => {
    const imageStyles = [
      styles.overlayHeart,
      {
        opacity: this.animatedValue,
        transform: [
          {
            scale: this.animatedValue.interpolate({
              inputRange: [0, 1],
              outputRange: [0.7, 1.5],
            }),
          },
        ],
      },
    ];

    return (
      <View style={styles.overlay}>
        <Animated.Image
          source={require('./images/heart.png')}
          style={imageStyles}
        />
      </View>
    );
  }

  // ...
}
```

That leaves us with the following.
